## Overview :clipboard:

This project is a web application that displays the user's Hack The Box status using the public user API key. The web application is built using Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and hosted on Render.com for free. The web application consists of two parts: server and client.
<br>

## Server  :gear:

The server is built using Node.js and makes a request to the Hack The Box public user API using the user's API key. The server receives the data from the API and passes it to the client.
<br>

## Client :computer:
The client is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and receives the data from the server. The client cleans and formats the data, and displays it in an attractive manner using a user interface designed with Figma and converted to HTML and CSS using LocoFy AI.
